> On 12th August I Came across this site while looking for ngo websites .They are doing exactly what I wanted, but their idea is more refined as they are doing it for a really long time and had raised about 2000+ Cr of amount through their website for the community. I really loved there site and it also gave a lot of good ideas to improve my project. I improvised few of my components and pages like the main fundraiser page, it also reflects in the UI.
