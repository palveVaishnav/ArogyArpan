### Inspiration from Milaap:

> On 12th August, I came across this site while looking for NGO websites. They are doing exactly what I wanted, but their idea is more refined as they have been doing it for a long time and have raised about 2000+ Cr of amount through their website for the community. I really loved their site, and it also gave me a lot of good ideas to improve my project. I improvised a few of my components and pages, like the main fundraiser page, and it also reflects in the UI.
